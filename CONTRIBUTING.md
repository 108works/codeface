## Contributing to the Codeface Repository

Contributions of new fonts that are free and appropriate for use in a source code editor are warmly welcomed.

* Fork the Codeface respository
* Add a new font directory that contains the font license as a text file and the font binary (or binaries) inside the `fonts` directory
* Submit a pull request back to the main repository

I will review the font and verify the license.  If the font is appropriate, I will generate the gallery image and take care of the rest.
