## Contributing to the Codeface Repository

Contributions of new fonts that are free and appropriate for use in a source code editor are warmly welcomed.

### The Elbow Grease Gang

* Fork the Codeface respository
* Add a new font directory that contains the font license as a text file and the font binary (or binaries) inside the `fonts` directory
* Submit a pull request back to the main repository
* Include a link to the font repository or download page in your pull request description

I will review the font and verify the license.  If the font is appropriate, I will generate the gallery images (currently a manual process...) and include the gallery link.

### The Lounge Chair Army

Please [post an issue request](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/codeface/issues/new) with a link to the font repository or download page where we can find the font.
