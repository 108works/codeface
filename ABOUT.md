## About Codeface

Codeface is a gallery and repository of monospaced fonts for developers.  Fonts displayed in the [main gallery](README.md) and [CJK gallery](CJK.md) are distributed through this repository.  The font name link will open the respective font directory where you can download fonts from each typeface.  This directory also includes the typeface license.

If you would like to download all of the fonts in the collection, please use the download button or links provided on the gallery page. 

## Fonts that are Not Distributed by Codeface

Fonts displayed in the [Non-redistribution gallery](NONDISTRIB.md) are free for desktop use; however, their licenses do not permit redistribution through the Codeface repository.  You can use the font name link to open the download page on the respective typeface site.

## Font Licensing

I have made every effort to identify and include licenses associated with the fonts that are distributed in this repository.  In some cases, this involved direct contact with the typeface developers to clarify any licensing issues that might prohibit redistribution in this project.  These licenses are linked below the typeface name in the gallery.  If you are the copyright holder of any font and feel that it has an incorrect license associated with it or this form of redistribution does not meet your license requirements, please let me know and I will rectify this immediately.   

## Gallery Image Settings

Main gallery images were generated with code in the Sublime Text 3 editor (OS X version) using a font size of 14 and the `subpixel_antialias` font_options setting.  Bitmap fonts were generated without the `subpixel_antialias` setting at font-specific recommended sizes (based upon review of the respective documentation).  Gallery images are displayed in a compressed png format.

CJK gallery images were generated as eps files using Scribus.  The confused character specimen (specimen #1) was generated at a font size of 9pt.  The CJK glyph display specimen (specimen #2) was generated at a font size of 14pt.  Screenshots were taken of these full size eps images and are displayed in the gallery in a compressed png format.
