## About Codeface

Codeface is a gallery and repository of monospaced fonts for developers.  Fonts displayed in the [main gallery](README.md) are distributed through this repository.  The font name link will open the respective font directory.  This includes the license associated with the font and the font binary or binaries that you can download by clicking on the binary name, then clicking on the `Raw` button in the upper right hand corner of the screen.

Fonts displayed in the [nondistrib gallery](NONDISTRIB.md) are free for desktop use; however, their licenses do not permit redistribution through the Codeface repository.  You can use the font name link to open the download page.

I have made every effort to identify and include all licenses associated with the fonts that are distributed in this repository.  If you are the developer or copyright holder of any font and feel that it has an inappropriate license associated with it, please let me know and I will rectify this immediately.
